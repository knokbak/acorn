# Acorn Anti-Cheat
Acorn is a new Anti-Cheat for Spigot 1.15. Acorn is free to use and can quickly detect hackers.

## Features
- Really, really quick fly detection
- Automatic punishments (cancel action, teleport back to name a couple)
- Extensive amounts of config options
- Custom alert messages
- Just works

## What is Acorn best at?
In my opinion, Acorn is really good at detecting illegal flying and reach.

## Videos
I'm hoping to make some more videos soon but until then, here's a showcase of some of the movement checks.
